# 6.4 Notes

# Regression Notes

my notes...
## 6.3 - Goodness of Fit
- **R²** : represents the proportion of the dependent variable's variance that the model takes in to account

- **Adjusted R²** : modifies R² to account for the number of variables in the model, preventing overfitting by penalizing the addition of less informative variables
  
- Uses diamond prices and coin wallet examples to demonstrate how these measures work in practice
  
- Models are important because they explain the variation in data and the risk of bias from omitting relevant variables

## 6.4 - Interpreting regression coefficients
- **Continuous Variables**: Coefficients indicate how the dependent variable changes with a one-unit change in the variable while holding other factors constant
  
- **Binary Variables**: Shows the difference in the dependent variable between the two groups identified by the binary variable
  
- **Categorical Variables**: Illustrate differences in the dependent variable across categories, compared to a reference category
  
- **Interaction Terms**: Reflect how the relationship between a variable and the dependent variable changes when another variable changes

## Regression

- R2 is a measure of how well the modwel fits the dataset
    - usually 0 to 1
    - R2 near 0 -- doesn't explain much.. sanity check
    - R2 near 1 -- can be a problem
    - R2 of 1 -- oops or waste of time
    - R2 below 0 -- means you're predicting stock prices
 
- Figuring out economics of coeffiecients
     - Direction + or -
     - magnitude
     - ""statistical significance""
     - Causality - take an econometrics class.. in this classs "x is assocaited with y"
 
- Interpreting coefficients
     - What kind of variable is Y (logged, or not)
     - What kind of variable is X (logged, or not)(if not: continuous, binary, categorical)
     - Is X interacted with other variables
     - Are there other vairables in the model
     - Best practices
